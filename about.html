<p class="aboutclass"> Global food security is an issue that results from numerous places, factors, and situations. These can range from
 global warming, to conflict between countries. The main root of food security problems, however, is the supply chain.
 The food supply chain accounts for all producing, processing, and distributing of different food sources throughout the
 world. With a fundamental understanding of how the supply chain operates, finding inconsistencies or drops in production would
 be crucial to coming up with countermeasures. To try and tackle the UN sustainability goal of “Zero Hunger”, this study will aim 
 to conduct an analysis of food supply chain data to look for patterns. As these patterns are found, they will be interpreted to 
 see if they represent an active problem in the supply chain. This will help us create some solutions to specific ongoing supply 
 issues that are happening, enabling stronger food security. Coming up with solutions to this problem gives people better access 
 to food, which can help fix or alleviate other problems revolving around food scarcity. This, in turn, can lead to the improvement
 of other sustainability goals. Not all supply chain issues are going to be addressed in this study, but the ones proposed could be
 an essential step in the right direction for fixing hunger problems around the world. </p>

	This website was created as our SLX project to try and research a topic revolving around a UN sustainability goal.
	It is IMSA’s mission to try and help achieve these seventeen goals, and this study was made around the UN goal of
	“Zero Hunger”. The website was made and contributed to by Ethan Charoenpitaks, Jonathan Handjojo, Owen Larkin, and
	Nathan Vortia. Our information can be found  at the top of the page under the “Pages” tab.
