				Recent events, such as the global coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine have called into question the ability of many countries to adequately feed their populations. Nearly 29.3% of people worldwide already do not have access to a stable supply of food, but disruptions to the global supply chain can cause major unpredictability in food supply in many developed countries as well. The inability to access food typically causes social instability and can even cause revolutions. Therefore, it is urgent to ensure that nations can consistently feed their growing population. This study will explore the nature of the global food supply chain and the challenges posed by disruptions to the global supply chain. We propose solutions and mitigations for these challenges, and explore parts of agriculture that may be able to increase food security and improve the resilience of localities to disruptions in the global supply chain, to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goal of “ZERO HUNGER”.

				Global food security is an issue that results from numerous places, factors, and situations. These can range from global warming to conflict between countries. The main root of food security problems, however, is the supply chain. The food supply chain accounts for all the production, processing, and distribution of different food sources throughout the world. With a fundamental understanding of how the supply chain operates, finding inconsistencies or drops in production would be crucial to coming up with countermeasures. To try and tackle the UN sustainability goal of “Zero Hunger”, this study will aim to conduct an analysis of food supply chain data to look for patterns. As these patterns are found, they will be interpreted to see if they represent an active problem in the supply chain. This will help us create some solutions to specific ongoing supply issues that are happening, enabling stronger food security. Coming up with solutions to this problem gives people better access to food, which can help fix or alleviate other problems revolving around food scarcity. This, in turn, can lead to the improvement of other sustainability goals. Not all supply chain issues are going to be addressed in this study, but the ones proposed could be an essential step in the right direction for fixing hunger problems around the world.

	This website was created as our SLX project to try and research a topic revolving around
	a UN sustainability goal. It is IMSA’s mission to try and help achieve these seventeen goals,
	and this study was made around the UN goal of “Zero Hunger”. The website was made and contributed
	to by Ethan Charoenpitaks, Jonathan Handjojo, Owen Larkin, and Nathan Vortia. Our information can
	be found  at the top of the page under the “Pages” tab.
